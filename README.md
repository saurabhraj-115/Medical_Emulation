# Medical_Emulation
This project will make sure that we can generate a medical data into a .json file and then fetch it as if it's a real data form the github repo and use it in a javascript file which will then open an html file which will then open an interface which will have three buttons.
Button#1 : It will display the data
Button#2 : It will push the data towards a certain IP
Button#3 : It will send data to an IP which will then encrypt the data and then send it to a broker and henceforward.
